Some tweets were inexplicably split up in multiple lines. Folding them into one
line shifted Maxim's starting point. Maxim's first change now sits at line
2957 . Given that it doesn't look like he had to collapse any tweets, and his
first change occurred at line 2978 prior to me collapsing tweets, that suggests
a current shift of -21 lines. So I assume Maxim's block starts at what is now
line 2919.
#### Maxim will take 2nd 1/3 of data     - 2940 - 5879
#### Marc will take 3rd 1/3 of data      - 5880 - 8818
